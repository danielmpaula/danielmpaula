I'm Dan. I haven't got a lot here, but a few public projects that can be displayed. 🌱

Might be interesting to see my MBA term paper 📜 a comparison between linear regressions and neural networks and some remedies to the main issues for those regressions, along with more explorations ideas.

Some interesting insights about the data professionals market could be drawn, and of course I'm working on them.
